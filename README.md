### Think in react Hooks version

### Start With A Mock
Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this:

[
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
];

### Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product

FilterableProductTable

    SearchBar
    ProductTable

        ProductCategoryRow
        ProductRow

### Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
 don’t use state at all to build this static version

### Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

Think about State

Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:

The original list of products
The search text the user has entered
The value of the checkbox
The filtered list of products
Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:

Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

So finally, our state is:

The search text the user has entered
The value of the checkbox

### Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.
React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy

For each piece of state in your application:

Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
Let’s run through this strategy for our application:

ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.
The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.
It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable

### Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow

-support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.
-Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated.

##And That’s It. Done

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
